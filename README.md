Users can filter by month, week number, or custom date ranges using slicers.

Allows comparison of current vs. previous time periods to understand business momentum.

Includes KPI cards with dynamic indicators

## KPI	Description
Average Daily Rate (ADR)	Measures the average revenue earned per room sold
Occupancy Rate	Shows how many rooms are sold out of total available rooms
Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)

KPI cards update dynamically based on slicer selections (e.g., selected week or month).

4.  Running Total Revenue (YTD / MTD Trendline)
Shows cumulative revenue as it grows over a month or year.
